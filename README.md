# SwigPoEFilter
Keeping versions of Path of Exile Loot Filters

Intending to keep versions here as PoE patches come out and loot filter additions are needed.
I try to keep a bundle of filters that basically become more strict as you need to pick less up.
Need to work on making a mapping filter that's pretty strict.

This started as ZiggyD's filter around Breach League, and I've kept it updated and modified for myself. Mine teaches relative worth of currency and things like different Divination Cards a bit better. Need to rework it heavily to make it more efficient and strict, so hopefully it'll look quite different when I get around to that.
